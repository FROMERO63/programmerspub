## Description

This motivation for this project was to create a site where a user can come to find a cocktail of their liking
We wanted to allow the user to have a random cocktail generated or have the option of a filtered drink list page
We added in options for likes and dislikes for the drinks
This solved the problem of coders being tired after work or school and not wanting to have to think about what drink to make
Some things that we learned in this challenge were use of APIs, how to separate tasks, preparing a presentation, creating a concept we wanted
I had difficulty working with images and trying to get the z-index to work, also had some trouble with commits and conflicts in Github when pushing to main

## Installation

This website was built by our team from scratch. We created a home page with links to the separate API filters for drinks of a sepecific alcohol type or a random drink. We used Bulma for the css styling.

## Usage
