## Description

The motivation for the project was to create a site where users can come to find a cocktail of their liking
We wanted to allow the user to have a random cocktail generated for them
We also wanted to user to be able to click on their preference of liquor and have drinks with that liquor recommended to them
We also wanted an option for feedback for the resident bartender on drink their drink recommendations
This solved the coders problem of being tired and not wanting to have to think about what to drink to wind down
Some things that we learned in this challenge were the use of APIs, click events, onload, links to alternate html pages, and how to work through the gitf workflow process

## Installation

This website was built by our team. We created the homepage with links to additional pages such as a random drink page and cocktails with recipes page
